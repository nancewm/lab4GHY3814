# Lab 4 Reflection

During this lab, I struggled to understand the code and how to get my data from a certain format to another. Nonetheless, I kept trying different methods and eventually got everything to work correctly. I learned how to change a CSV file to a JSON file and that will help me tremendously in the future. I enjoyed the lab as well as the data I used to complete my map. I completed a proportional symbol map using data from The Census Bureau on household income by state. Overall, I would say that I am progressing a lot in the labs and am understanding more and more every time I work with atom. I was comfortable enough to change all the colors of the map and find different color codes on the web. I also experimented with the scaling of the circles and was pleased with the way they turned out.
