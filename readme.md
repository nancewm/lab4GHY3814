# Lab 4 Reflection

When I began making this application I knew I wanted to show the map user the data through proportional symbolization. I chose median household income for each state and chose circles scaled to represent the amount for each state. I made these circles as well as the map title green because I thought green went along with a monetary theme. I chose the circles to turn a beige color when the map user hovers over them. Overall, I think I conveyed the data in an appropriate way, as the map user can clearly tell the difference between the income in Mississippi versus Washington.
